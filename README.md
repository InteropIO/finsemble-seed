# Finsemble Seed ðŸŒ±

Note, the finsemble-seed project is intended for developers. If you're looking to get going quickly without any development then [contact us](https://cosaic.io/contact/) to get access to the **Finsemble Smart Desktop Designer** - a no-code GUI tool for assembling an FDC3 compliant smart desktop. If you are an existing Finsemble client, contact us at [support@finsemble.com](mailto:support@finsemble.com) to start using the Smart Desktop Designer.

## What is the "seed"?

Finsemble is a smart desktop platform. A smart desktop is a desktop based application that is composed from any number of smaller apps, including web, native and Citrix. Finsemble supports the [FDC3](https://fdc3.finos.org/) 1.2 standard for desktop interop.

This repo, the "seed", is an initial empty project for your smart desktop. The seed gives you the ability to launch Finsemble and is the starting point for assembling your smart desktop.
