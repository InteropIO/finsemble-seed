<!-- On MacOS, an entitlement is a string that grants an app-specific permissions to perform specific tasks 
that may have an impact on the integrity of the system or user privacy. 

Entitlements are specified as key-value pairs that grant an executable permission to use a service or technology.

When you sign your app, the entitlements file, information from your developer account, and other project information are combined
 to apply a final set of entitlements to your app.
