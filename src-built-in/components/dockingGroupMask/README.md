## Docking Group Mask

---

### Overview

The docking group mask is a temporary window that's shown and resized as the user resizes a rectangular-shaped-group of windows. The default styling is semi-transparent blue with a thick border. It's hard to tell in the screenshot below, but that's actually a window that's masking several windows.
