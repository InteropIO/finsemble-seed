/**
 * The webpacking for WindowTitleBar differs from other components because it does not make use of the "vendor bundle".
 * The vendor bundle allows common libraries such as react, react-dom to be consolidated into a single js file.
 * Finsemble's built-in UI components make use of this vendor bundle but this cannot be counted on for external
 * components.
 *
 * Note: this will be unnecessary once WindowTitleBar is separated from app content via a BrowserView.
